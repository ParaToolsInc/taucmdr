TAU Storage Containers.

A storage container provides a record database, a persistent filesystem, and a key/value store.
The database is accessed via member methods like :any:`insert`, :any:`search`, etc.
The filesystem is accessed via its filesystem prefix (e.g. ``/usr/local/packages``) via :any:`prefix`.
The key/value store is accessed via the `[]` operator, i.e. treat the storage object like a dictionary.
