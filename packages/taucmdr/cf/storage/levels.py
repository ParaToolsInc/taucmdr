"""TAU Commander hierarchical file and record storage system.

System-level records are globally readable and writable, depending on the user's
system access level.  System-level is a good place for software package installations
and some system-specific configurations, e.g. target or compiler configurations.

User-level records are readable and writable by (at least) the user.  User-level is also
where software is installed when the user doesn't have write access to :any:`SYSTEM_PREFIX`.
It's a good place for user-specific records, i.e. preferences or encrypted login credentials.

Project-level records define the project and its member components.  The user may also
want to install software packages at the project level to avoid quotas or in situations
where :any:`USER_PREFIX` is not accessible from cluster compute nodes.
