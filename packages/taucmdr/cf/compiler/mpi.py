"""MPI compiler knowledgebase.

MPI compilers are a special case for several reasons including:
    1) No binary compatibility guarantee among MPI compilers.
    2) They're almost always wrappers, not actual compilers.
    3) They almost always depend on CPU compilers.

We keep a separate knowledge base for MPI compilers to simplify compiler
identification and because TAU doesn't require MPI for all configurations.
