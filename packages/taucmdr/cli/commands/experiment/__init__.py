TAU Commander Experiments:
=========================================================================
An experiment is defined by: a target, an application, a measurement. Create
experiments by entering:

`tau select <profile_name> <target_name> <measurement_name>`

If the target, application, or measurement name can be implied then it may be
omitted.  For example, if you have only one target and only one application in
your project then only the measurement name must be specified:

`tau select my_profile`

The select command will name the new experiment based on the names of the
selected objects.  You may rename the new experiment with the tau experiment
edit command, or take full control of experiment creation by explicitly
specifying each parameter:

`tau experiment create <experiment_name> --application <application_name>
--measurement <measurement_name> --target <target_name>`    The entities
experiment, application and measurement must already be defined.
