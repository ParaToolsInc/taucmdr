 TAU Commander Build
==============================================================================

After configuring TAU Commander and placing the bin directory in your path
build with “tau” prefixes. This would be something like `tau cc`,
`tau f77`, or `tau mpicxx`, . . .  Edit the Makefile to use compilers
with `tau` prefixes.  Changing the selected experiment typically will
require that you rebuild your application binaries – depending on
what changes.  TAU Commander will remind you to rebuild your binary
executable.

The list of compilers supported by TAU Commander is in the list below this help
section.

To selectively control instrumentation for files or routines that are part of
the binary to be analyzed, see the select-file options in the TAU Commander
Applications section.
