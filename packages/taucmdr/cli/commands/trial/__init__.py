TAU Commander trials
=========================================================================

A trial is created by running the binary: `tau trial create ./a.out <args>`
more commonly though it is simply created by using the tau prefix and
execution command - that is: `tau ./a.out` or `tau mpirun -np # ./a.out <args>`.
The binary a.out will be executed and the TAU Commander specified data
will be collected.  This completes data collection to form a trial.

Delete a trial: `tau trial delete <trial_number>`

Edit a trial: `tau trial edit <trial_number> --description <free form text>`

Export a trial: `tau trial export <trial_number> [optional arg]`
Optional argument is:  `--destination <path>`

Viewing data for a trial: Enter `tau trial show` or `tau show` and
TAU Commander will open up the appropriate display window to
graphically show the data of the trial.  This will be the last trial
collected with the active or selected experiment.  To see data for
a different trial for this experiment just enter the trial number
after show (e.g. `tau trial show 0`).  Please note that trial numbers
begin with 0.  The first trial is trial number 0.   If tau dashboard
shows 3 trials those 3 trials are numbered 0, 1, 2

Alternatively, you may enter: `tau show <trial #>` This will have the
same affect as: `tau trial show #`

You may also specify files instead of trial numbers, in this case enter:
`tau show <data_file>` or `tau trial show <data_file>`
