/**
 * OAuth Authentication Protocol
 *
 * OAuth 1.0 is a delegated authentication strategy that involves multiple
 * steps. First, a request token must be obtained. Next, the user is redirected
 * to the service provider to authorize access. Finally, after authorization has
 * been granted, the user is redirected back to the application and the request
 * token can be exchanged for an access token. The application requesting access,
 * known as a consumer, is identified by a consumer key and consumer secret.
 *
 * For more information on OAuth in Passport.js, check out:
 * http://passportjs.org/guide/oauth/

 * @param {Object}   req
 * @param {string}   token
 * @param {string}   tokenSecret
