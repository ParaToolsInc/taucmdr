        Stylesheets and Preprocessors
        ==============================

        You can always bring in CSS files manually with `<link>` tags, or asynchronously
        using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can take advantage 
        of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

        By default, stylesheets from your `assets/styles` folder are included
        here automatically (between STYLES and STYLES END). Both CSS (.css) and LESS (.less)
        are supported. In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into
        a single file.
        
        To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
        For example, here are a few things you could do:
            
            + Change the order of your CSS files
            + Import stylesheets from other directories
            + Use a different or additional preprocessor, like SASS, SCSS or Stylus

        Client-side Templates
        ========================

        HTML templates are important prerequisites of modern, rich client applications.
        To work their magic, frameworks like Backbone, Angular, Ember, and Knockout require
        that you load these templates client-side.

        By default, your Gruntfile is configured to automatically load and precompile
        client-side JST templates in your `assets/templates` folder, then
        include them here automatically (between TEMPLATES and TEMPLATES END).
        
        To customize this behavior to fit your needs, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
        For example, here are a few things you could do:

            + Import templates from other directories
            + Use a different template engine (handlebars, jade, dust, etc.)
            + Internationalize your client-side templates using a server-side
              stringfile before they're served.

      Client-side Javascript
      ========================

      You can always bring in JS files manually with `script` tags, or asynchronously
      on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can 
      take advantage of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

      By default, files in your `assets/js` folder are included here
      automatically (between SCRIPTS and SCRIPTS END).  Both JavaScript (.js) and
      CoffeeScript (.coffee) are supported. In production, your scripts will be minified
      and concatenated into a single file.
      
      To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
      For example, here are a few things you could do:
          
          + Change the order of your scripts
          + Import scripts from other directories
          + Use a different preprocessor, like TypeScript
