This directory contains an example of the java TAU trace writer API, equivalent 
to the C/C++ example in the tracewriter directory.  The C/C++ API reference is 
applicable, but note that Time is passed as a java long primitive, character 
arrays are passed as strings and other numeric values are passed as ints.

To use this API, ensure that your CLASSPATH contains the file 
<tau>/<arch>/lib/tf_writer.jar.

For example, starting in the TAU root directory,

$ ./configure -TRACE
$ make clean install
$ cd examples/javatracewriter
$ export CLASSPATH=/home/wspear/tau2/i386_linux/lib/tf_writer.jar

Now compile the trace writer application.

$ javac jtau_writer.java

And run it

$ java jtau_writer

$ tau_convert -dump tau.trc tau.edf
