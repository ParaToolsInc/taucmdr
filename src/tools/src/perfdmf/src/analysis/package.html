Provides an API for performing distance analysis in a parallel application.

<p>
This code is largely based on the work of Sherwood, Perelman, Hamerly
and Calder, in their paper "Automatically Characterizing Large Scale
Program Behavior", 2002.  In that paper, they describe the algorithm for
calculating distance metrics between phases of a serial executable.  In
this implementation, the phases are replaced by threads or events.
Instead of comparing blocks of code to find phases of execution, the user
can compare either threads or events.  See the referenced paper for more
details.
