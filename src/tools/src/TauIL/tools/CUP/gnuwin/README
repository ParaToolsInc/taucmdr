Subject: Makefile for NT/DOS

I've made (hah) a Makefile for java_cup that will install and test java_cup
on NT/9x/DOS with GNU Make...

You (should) find it attached.

thanks,

jon

The Makefile included is for Microsoft's (I think) Nmake...  it doesn't
jive with just plain old GNU make (At least not on my machine..)  Also, the
Makefile I wrote _should_ (I haven't tested it, though) work (with minor
changes) on Un*x and WinTel machines...

thanks,

jon
