Hey all!

I am adding another PerfExplorer example (the second of many, I hope).  These
are two scripts which I wrote at BSC for extracting events for a profile in
order to then create a specification file for tau_instrumentor (which will then
selectively instrument the application with mpitrace_userfunction() calls).
The first script finds the top X events from a profile.  The second script
finds the top X events in a callpath profile with a given parent event.  I am
also including three PPK files and a gprof profile for testing purposes.

Also, I am including two wrapper bash scripts.  These wrapper bash scripts will
call perfexplorer with the appropriately formatted parameters, since the
perfexplorer parameter specification is pretty clumsy.

These scripts are to be used in the following case study:
* user has slow app
* user builds with TAU/PDT or -pg
* user uses getTopX to get top X functions
* user instruments application using generated list of functions
* user analyzes profile/trace from selectively instrumented application
* (some magic/expertise happens)
* user now has fast app
