This example was written by Timothy H. Kaiser (SDSC) and it demonstrates the 
use of TAU instrumentation for OpenMPI (OpenMP+MPI) programs. It uses C source
level instrumentation in addition to Opari's OpenMP instrumentation and MPI wrapper library level instrumentation.
It solves the 2d Stommel Model of Ocean Circulation using a Five-point 
stencil and Jacobi iteration

 gamma*((d(d(psi)/dx)/dx) + (d(d(psi)/dy)/dy))
 +beta(d(psi)/dx)=-alpha*sin(pi*y/(2*ly))

We gratefully acknowledge the help of Tim Kaiser for making this example 
available to us. 

To execute the program:

% setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 2
% mpirun -np 2 stommel

It reads st.in file (which should be present in this directory) and generates
performance data.
