This example can be used on one or more cores using MPI, pthread, OpenMP or with a hybrid MPI+<thread> runtime. It features a selective instrumentation file that uses outer-loop level instrumentation in two routines. 

To use compiler based instrumentation:
setenv TAU_OPTIONS '-optCompInst -optVerbose'
make
