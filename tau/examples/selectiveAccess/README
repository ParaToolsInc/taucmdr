This API basically allow an application access to TAU's internal
data. You can access the function list, and all data at function name
resolution.  Also, you can access user defined event data.
In the example, the beginning and end of the main()
function contains internal data access function examples.

The list of macros that are used in this example are:
-----------------------------------------------------
* TAU_GET_FUNC_NAMES(functionList, numOfFunctions); 
 It gets the list of routines that are active. 
* TAU_DUMP_FUNC_NAMES(); 
 It writes the names of active functions to a file (dump_functionnames_n,c.0.0).
* TAU_GET_COUNTER_NAMES(counterList, numOfCounters);
 It gets the list of counters. 
* TAU_GET_FUNC_VALS(inFuncs, 2,
                      counterExclusiveValues,
                      counterInclusiveValues,
                      numOfCalls,
                      numOfSubRoutines,
                      counterNames,
                      numOfCouns);

 It gets detailed performance data for the list of routines. The user 
 specifies inFuncs and and the number of routines (2); TAU then returns the 
 other arguments with the performance data. counterExclusiveValues and 
 counterInclusiveValues are two dimensional arrays: 
 the first dimension is the routine id and the second is counter id. The value
 is indexed by these two dimensions. numOfCalls and numOfSubRoutines are one
 dimensional arrays. See the simple.cpp file for its usage. 

* TAU_DUMP_FUNC_VALS_INCR(inFuncs, 1);
 Does the same as above, except that it dumps the results with a date
 stamp to the filename: sel_dump__Thu-Mar-28-16:30:48-2002__.0.0.0
 The result is that previous TAU_DUMP_FUNC_VALS_INCR(...) are not
 overwritten (unless they occur within a second).

* TAU_DB_DUMP_INCR();
 Similar to TAU_DB_DUMP except that it, like the above, dumps
 with a date stamp to the file name.

* TAU_GET_EVENT_NAMES(eventList, numEvents);
 Retrieves a list of user defined events.

* TAU_GET_EVENT_VALS(eventList, numEvents, numSamples, max, min, mean, sumSqr);
 Retrieves user defined event data.  The user specifies the list of
events to get, and gets back 5 arrays.  numSamples, an array of
integers corresponding to the number of samples taken for the given
user event.  Max, min, mean, and sumSqr (sum squared) contain the
statistical data available for user defined events.
