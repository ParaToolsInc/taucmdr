This example has one experiment, and the experiment has 5 trials.

The goal is to build a stacked area chart of time spent only in
SCF-cycle and the other functions under it in the call tree. The
first script, graph.py, is just the first level of functions under
SCF-cycle, and the other script has all functions under SCF-cycle.
