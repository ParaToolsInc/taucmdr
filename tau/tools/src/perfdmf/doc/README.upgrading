Notes for upgrading from tau-2.13:

If you are upgrading from tau-2.13, please make sure that you run 
the conversion SQL commands before trying to use the updated perfdmf 
commands.  To run the SQL commands with the PostgreSQL DBMS and a 
database named "perfdb", do the following:

	$ psql perfdb < $TAUROOT/tools/src/dms/data/conversion.sql
