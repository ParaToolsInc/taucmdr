TAU Instrumentation Language TODO List

               (low)  (new idea) (feature) (defect)   (high)       

1.) Implement parser error recovery (the auto-generated scheme sucks). (8)

2.) Implement error and warning reporting code (Exists, needs to be added to
    code in conjunction with error recovery and reporting). (7)

3.) Update abstract syntax rewriting code to direct ouput to a PrintStream.
    Current implementation recursively builds a string. Large syntax trees
    would result in very large strings. Hence would be better to write to
    destination immediately. (4)

4.) Update to use profile.*.*.* files instead of pprof dump files. Rather
    should allow both, but assume profile.*.*.* files as default. (6)

5.) Add support for multiple counters. (5)

6.) Advanced example. Show use of macros, repository of common instrumentation
    scenarios, scenarios other than removal of lightweight routines, etc. (5)

7.) Add regular expression package. Current implemntation copies expressions
    into file list, and leaves it up to the tau_instrumentor to evaluate them.
    Therefore, regular expressions are restricted to those understood by the
    instrumentor. (5)

8.) Automation of the tool chain process. Currently requires use of cxxparse,
    tau_instrumentor to instrument, compile, run program, tau_analyze to analyze, 
    tau_instrumentor to instrument based on analysis, run refined program. Can
    make the resulting Makefile for even a simple program a mess. (2)

9.) More in depth coverage of tool usage in users manual. (5)

10.) Make sure code is well documented. Public interface have been documented to
     to generate API documenation with javadoc. (4)

11.) Anaylze performance. In particular look at the impact large syntax trees have
     on tool performance. (3)

12.) Allow totals on a per-node basis as well as cumulative totals. (Requires the
     ability to read from profile files.) (5)

13.) Compatability mode to support tau_reduce rules. This would merely require the
     use of a drop-in parser since TauIL was built on the orginal tau_reduce
     syntax. (6)
