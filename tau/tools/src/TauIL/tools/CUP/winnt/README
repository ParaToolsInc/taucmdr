Subject: Java cup under Windows NT.

I wanted to try java cup under Windows NT.  Rather than transliterating the
csh shell script, I put together a little makefile for it.  I thought you
might want to include it in the distribution so that it is available for the
next person that wants to use java cup under Windows NT.

To use, place this file in the root javacup directory (where the "java_cup"
directory lives), and type "nmake" from that directory.

[The makefile has been included in this directory. -- CSA 24-Mar-1998 ]
