#rule grammar: FIELD OPERATOR NUMBER
#FIELD = numcalls, numsubrs, usec, cumusec, stddev, count, totalcount,
#        percent, usecs/call, counts/call
#OPERATOR = <, >, =
#NUMBER = any number (may use scientific notation, ie, 1000000 or 1e+6)

#usec > 1000 & numcalls > 400000 & percent > 10 & usecs/call < 75
#this rule should give same results of the previous rule--which
#will ultimately be ignored because the results are duplicated
