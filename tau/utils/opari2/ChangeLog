------------------- Released version 1.0.7-rc1------------------------

- Simplify the generation the POMP2 init region file. Previously
  opari2-config had to be called in a sequence (--egrep, --egrep,
  --awk-cmd, --awk-script). This sequence is replaced by opari2-config
  --region-initialization.

- Comments in macros are now ignored when processing.

------------------- Released version 1.0.6 ---------------------------

- Changed opari-config option --pomp2-api-version to
  --interface-version to make it consitent with otf2-config and
  cube-config.

------------------- Released version 1.0.5 ---------------------------

- Fix invalid insertion of <file>.opari.inc in conjunction with
  continued 'dimension' statements.

- Improved Fortran 'end do' detection.

- CTC-strings grew to long for Fortran77. Size reduced.

- Use inode instead of gettimeofday as unique region identifier. In
  very special circumstances gettimeofday resolution leads to
  non-unique identifiers.

- CTC-strings contained wrong line-number information.

- Create temporary files in the directory of the output file.

- Detection of conditional compilation in free form Fortran improved.

------------------- Released version 1.0.4 ---------------------------

- Provide correct region line numbers also for lazy initialization
  during runtime. Previosly the region end line was always 0 for lazy
  initialization.

- Improved region end line number handling in conjunction with omitted
  Fortran '!$omp end do' or '!$omp end parallel do' directives.

- Fix invalid insertion of <file>.opari.inc in Fortran77 codes with
  arbitrary continuation line characters in column 6.

- Fix invalid insertion of <file>.opari.inc in Fortran codes in
  conjunction with subroutine calls that distribute their arguments
  over several lines.

------------------- Released version 1.0.3 ---------------------------

- Prevent OPARI2 from instrumenting Fortran 'abstract interfaces'.

- Fix invalid insertion of <file>.opari.inc in conjunction with
  Fortran 'USE' statements that contain line continuations.

- Fix invalid insertion of <file>.opari.inc in conjunction with
  user-defined operators containing '=' in Fortran 'USE' statements.

- Fix instrumentation of .c files that produce a linker/mangling error
  when compiled with a C++ compiler.

- Support for out-of-place a.k.a. VPATH builds. Generate
  <file>.opari.inc in the directory of the output file.

- Fix instrumentation bug (C++ files only) where IBM and PGI compilers
  expect threadprivate variables in different locations.

------------------- Released version 1.0.2 ---------------------------

- Renaming of the configure related variable LD_FLAGS_FOR_BUILD to 
  LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD for consistency.

- Renaming of the installed script pomp2_parse_init_regions.awk to 
  pomp2-parse-init-regions.awk for consistency.

- In Fortran, improved parsing of function and subroutine keywords.

- In in-place builds, the [dist]clean targets accidentially removed
  files. 

- Create task events only for tasks that actually get created.

- In Fortran, added `integer ( kind=4 )' to all integer variables 
  instrumented by opari2.

- In Fortran, continuation lines ending with comments were not 
  detected as continuation lines (Ticket 77).

------------------- Released version 1.0.1 ---------------------------

- In Fortran, continued format descriptors resulted in invalid include
  of the opari.inc file (Ticket 76).

- In Fortran, rename lists resulted in premature include of the
  opari.inc file (Ticket 75).
