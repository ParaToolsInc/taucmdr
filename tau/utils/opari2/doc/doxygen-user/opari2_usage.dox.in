Usage: opari2 [OPTION] ... infile [outfile]
            
with following options and parameters:

[--f77|--f90|--c|--c++]  [OPTIONAL] Specifies the programming language
                         of the input source file. This option is only
                         necessary if the automatic language detection
                         based on the input file suffix fails.

[--nosrc]                [OPTIONAL] If specified, OPARI2 does not
                         generate #line constructs, which allow to
                         preserve the original source file and line
                         number information, in the transformation
                         process. This option might be necessary if
                         the OpenMP compiler does not understand #line
                         constructs.  The default is to generate #line
                         constructs.

[--nodecl]               [OPTIONAL] Disables the generation of 
                         POMP2_DLISTXXXXX macros. These are used in the
                         parallel directives of the instrumentation to 
                         make the region handles shared. By using this
                         option the shared clause is used directly on
                         the parallel directive with the resprective
                         region handles.

[--tpd]                  [OPTIONAL] Adds the clause 'copyin(<pomp_tpd>)'
                         to any parallel construct. This allows to
                         pass data from the creating thread to its
                         children. The variable is declared externally
                         in all files, so it needs to be defined by
                         the pomp library.

[--disable=<constructs>] [OPTIONAL] Disable the instrumentation of
                         manually-annotated POMP regions or the
                         more fine-grained OpenMP constructs such as
                         !$OMP ATOMIC. <constructs> is a comma
                         separated list of the constructs for which
                         the instrumentation should be disabled.
                         Accepted tokens are atomic, critical, master,
                         flush, single, ordered or locks (as well as 
                         sync to disable all of them) or regions.

[--task=                 Special treatment for the task directive
      abort|warn|remove] abort:  Stop instrumentation with an error
                                 message when encountering a task
                                 directive.
                         warn:   Resume but print a warning.
                         remove: Remove all task directives.

[--untied=               Special treatment for the untied task attribute.
     abort|keep|no-warn] The default beavior is to remove the untied
                         attribute, thus making all tasks tied, and print
                         out a warning.
                         abort:   Stop instrumentation with an error
                                  message when encountering a task 
                                  directive with the untied attribute.
                         keep:    Do not remove the untied attribute.
                         no-warn: Do not print out a warning.

[--tpd-mangling=         [OPTIONAL] If programming languages are mixed
 gnu|intel|sun|pgi|      (C and Fortran), the <pomp_tpd> needs to use
 ibm|cray]               the Fortran mangled name also in C files.
                         This option specifies to use the mangling
                         scheme of the gnu, intel, sun, pgi or ibm
                         compiler. The default is to use the mangling
                         scheme of the compiler used to build opari2.

[--version]              [OPTIONAL] Prints version information.

[--help]                 [OPTIONAL] Prints this help text.

infile                   Input file name.

[outfile]                [OPTIONAL] Output file name. If not
                         specified, opari2 uses the name
                          infile.mod.suffix if the input file is
                         called infile.suffix.
