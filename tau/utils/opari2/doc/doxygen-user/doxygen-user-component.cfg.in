# will adjust the colors in the stylesheet and background images according to
# this color. Hue is specified as an angle on a colorwheel, see
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue for more information. For instance the
# value 0 represents red, 60 is yellow, 120 is green, 180 is cyan, 240 is
# blue, 300 purple, and 360 is red again. The allowed range is 0 to 359.
