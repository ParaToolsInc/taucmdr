***********************************************************
 -Subroutine gsync() has changed to nekgsync() to avoid
	possible conflict on certain architectures

 -Executable is renamed 'nekbone' to replace 'nekproxy' and
	other naming changes.

 -iel0 and ielN  set in data.rea file are now used to control the
 	range of tests ran.  Test range in size from iel0
	to ielN elements per process.  (prevoiusly tests 
	were ran from 1 to lelt elements per process)  The
	maximum value of ielN is lelt.

 -nx0 and nxN set in data.rea file are now used to control the
	range of polynomial orders.   Ranging from nx0 to 
	nxN, where nxN<=lx1 (which is set in SIZE).  Previously
	tests only ran with nx1=lx1.  The default is set to
	reflect this, but nekbone now supports a range of
	polynomial orders without recompiling the code.

*              Changes in 2.1                             *
***********************************************************
 -Fixed nx0 and nxN control of polynomial order.  Default is
 	now to use lx1 until further notice.  Variable 
	nx1 caused memory unstabilities and needs further 
	development.
 -Fixed a memory copy bug in the jl/ array transfer code.  
	sarray_trasfer, used for the tuple transfer, should
	be fixed now.

***********************************************************
*              Changes in 2.3                             *
***********************************************************
 - added OpenMP parallelism, MPITHREADS preprocessor macro
   controls if MPI is called from one or multiple threads
 - added timers controlled by TIMERS preprocessor macro
 - fixed gather-scatter operation gsop() to always use pairwise
   method
 - switched to using system_clock routine in dummy mpi_wtime()
