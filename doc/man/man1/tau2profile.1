.SH "NAME"
tau2profile \- convert TAU tracefiles to TAU profile files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 13
\fBtau2vprofile\fR [\fB\-d\fR\ \fIdirectory\fR] [\fB\-s\fR\ \fIsnapshot_interval\fR] {\fItau_tracefile\fR} {\fItau_eventfile\fR}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This program is generated when TAU is configured with the \-TRACE option.
.PP
The tau2profile converter takes a single tau_tracefile (*.trc) and tau_eventfile (*.edf) and produces a corresponding series of profile files. The input files must be specified in that order, with optinal parameters coming afterward. Multi\-file TAU traces must be merged before conversion.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-d\fR
Output profile files to the specified 'directory' rather than the current directory.
.PP
\fB\-s\fR
Output a profile snapshot showing the state of the profile data accumulated from the trace every 'snapshot_interval' time units. The snapshot profiles are placed sequentially in directories labled 'snapshot_n' where 'n' is an integer ranging from 0 to to the total number of snapshots \-1.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The program must be run with the tau trace and tau event files specified in the command line in that order. Any additional arguments follow. The following will produce a profile file array, from the TAU trace and event files merged.trc and tau.edf trace file:
.sp
.nf
tau2profile merged.trc tau.edf
      
.fi
.sp
The following will convert merged.trc and tau.edf to a series of profiles one directory higher. It will also produce a profile snapshot every 250,000 time units:
.sp
.nf
tau2profile merged.trc tau.edf \-d ./.. \-s 250000
      
.fi
.sp
