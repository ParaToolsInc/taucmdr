.SH "NAME"
tau_treemerge.pl \- combine multiple node and or thread TAU tracefiles into a merged tracefile
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 17
\fBtau_treemerge.pl\fR [\fB\-n\fR\ \fIbreak_amount\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
tau_treemerge.pl is generated when TAU is configured with the \-TRACE option.
.PP
This tool assembles a set of tau trace and event files from multiple multiple nodes or threads across a program's execution into a single unified trace file. Many TAU trace file tools operate on merged trace files.
.PP
tau_treemerge.pl will generate the specified merged trace file and an event definition file, tau.edf by default.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-n\fR
break_amount set the maximum number of trace files to merge in each invocation of tau_merge. If we need to merge 2000 trace files and if the maximum number of open files specified by unix is 250, tau_treemerge.pl will incrementally merge the trace files so as not to exceed the number of open file descriptors.
