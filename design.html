<h2>TAM Model<a class="headerlink" href="#tam-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now we can compose sets of Targets, Applications, and Measurements to form workflows.  This is the <em>TAM Model</em>.  Here
are some example workflows.  At this point we&#8217;re still very general and any tool could do this, not just TAU Commander.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Application Performance Analysis</em>: One target, one application, many measurements.  By holding the target and
application constant while we vary the measurement config we explore the different performance characteristics of the
application when executing in a well-defined hardware/software environment.</li>
<li><em>System Benchmarking</em>: One target, many applications, one measurement.  By holding the target and measurement
constant while varying the application we explore how well this particular target executes different workloads.</li>
<li><em>Environment Tuning / Compiler Comparison / Hardware Acquisition / Purchasing</em>:  Many targets, one application,
one measurement.  By holding the application and measurement constant while varying the target we discover which
target produces the optimal performance characteristics for a specific application.</li>
</ul>
<p>The notation for a TAM workflow is (TN1,AN2,MN3) where N[123] are integers or the &#8216;*&#8217; symbol.  Our above example
workflows are denoted, in order:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(T1,A1,M*)</li>
<li>(T1,A*,M1)</li>
<li>(T*,A1,M1)</li>

<h2>TAU Commander Definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#tau-commander-definitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

to TAU Commander:</p>

completely describes the hardware and software that produce performance data (if any).  Note that <em>not</em> producing any
data is a valid experimental result, i.e. this particular experiment raises a fault in the application.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field-even field"><th class="field-name">Trial:</th><td class="field-body">The result of performing an experiment including at least the generated performance data (if any), a record
of the user&#8217;s runtime environment (e.g. PATH), and timestamps marking the start and end of the trial.  The TAU
Commander user performs many trial to minimize variance in the dataset.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field-odd field"><th class="field-name">Project:</th><td class="field-body">A container for grouping TAM workflows that relate to a common objective along with the data produced by
the workflow (i.e. trials).  A project may contain any number of Target, Application, and Measurement objects and
these objects may be shared between many projects.</td>

<h2>TAU Commander Example<a class="headerlink" href="#tau-commander-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Suppose I have an application that uses MPI and OpenMP and I want to see how performance varies when I use MPI only,
OpenMP only, or both together on the same target configuration.  I want to show time spent in MPI communication and
OpenMP regions and directives whenever those features are active.</p>
<p>First I create an empty project to hold my configuration objects.  (Or you could create the objects first then add them
to a project later. Or reuse TAM objects from another existing project.  Order doesn&#8217;t matter.)  Then I create TAM
configuration objects to describe the problem and add them to the project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Target</em>: One target that includes a compiler that supports OpenMP and a path to an MPI installation.</li>
<li><em>Application</em>: Three applications: one for MPI only, one for OpenMP only, one for both MPI and OpenMP.</li>
<li><em>Measurement</em>: Three measurements:  one for MPI only, one for OpenMP only, one for both MPI and OpenMP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then for each case that I&#8217;m interested in I form experiments by selecting one target, one application, and one
measurement and execute the experiment as many times as I like to produce 1...N trials.  I can produce as many trials
as I like to get a good idea of performance variability in the system.  The gathered data is organized something like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Project (my-project)
  - Experiment (my-target, MPI, MPI-measurement)
    - Trial_1 ... Trial_N
  - Experiment (my-target, OpenMP, OpenMP-measurement)
    - Trial_1 ... Trial_N
  - Experiment (my-target, MPI_OpenMP, MPI_OpenMP-measurement)
    - Trial_1 ... Trial_N
</pre></div>
